  <h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am new to the wonderful world of Blogging and am very pleased to be able to share with you all my interesting and unique thoughts around the wonderful world of television.
</p>
</div>
<p>As I have always been intrigued about the magic of the TV universe, how it can transport you to another world and take you to another place and time. Where you can test your knowledge and imagination all in one place and see the words from a page come to life before your eyes.
</p>
<p>It has been what had linked my interests and passions all in one place for many years, bringing it all together on a screen. 
</p>
<p>And I am also now able to do that in my day-to-day life as a student at Oxford Brookes university.
</p>
<p>So if you’re a TV and little bit of a history buff like I am, you’ve come to the right place, go and check out my TV Typography blog!
