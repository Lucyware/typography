## **ABOUT ME**

Hey there, I'm Lucy and welcome to TV Typography! 

I am new to the wonderful world of Blogging and am very pleased to be able to share with you all my interesting and unique thoughts around the wonderful world of television. 

As I have always been intrigued about the magic of the TV universe, how it can transport you to another world and take you to another place and time. Where you can test your knowledge and imagination all in one place. See the words from a page come to life before your eyes. 

It has been what had linked my interests and passions all in one place, on one screen. 

And I am also now able to do that in my day-to-day life as a student at Oxford Brookes university.

So if you’re a TV and little bit of a history buff like I am, you’ve come to the right place. 

## **ABOUT THE SITE**

My goals for this site is it to be a place for people to quench their curiosity on the reasons behind why you are attracted to a certain tv programme and thoughts gone in behind it to associate it your specific brand.
